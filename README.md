# Third-Homework

## Password generator code refactoring/generating
This project was to take an existing source code which will be linked below, and build the Javascript up to meet the acceptance criteria to create a functioning passwork generator.

## Usage 
This webpage is used to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters, with the users selection from character arrays containing Upper and Lower case letters, Numerical characters and Special characters. The password is then generated based on the users choices and displayed on the viewport.
